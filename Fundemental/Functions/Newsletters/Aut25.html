        <p>Welcome to the first FPE-RPG newsletter, folks!</p>

        <p>Can you tell Toby heavily inspired this yet??</p>
        <p>No matter, we must go on!</p>

        <p>There’s a few things to talk about before we get to the jokes and pranks of the newsletter so get ready!</p>

        <p>First off, no, the game isn’t in coding development YET, I still need to wait until I can get a copy of RPG maker (or like Godot or GMS or smth idk)</p>

        <p>We do have a LOT planned though, especially characters, which I’ll get to in a moment</p>

        <p>I still don’t have any music but you know what I do have?</p>

        <p>SPRITES!</p>
 
        <p>I have some dialogue portraits for Edward, along with a font and other text box things</p>

        <p>NO i will NOT show you all of them. I still need to keep SOME secrets</p>


        <h2>Characters</h2>

<p>Pip:<br>
    Pip is a kind and knowledgeable fellow. Although not a nerd, he still does well in most things. He likes chess and tends to play it with Zip. He’s on good terms with Engel but not really part of his group. He’s also Zip’s brother. This could change in development though. Character by me! (Caty!)</p>

<p>Matthew Lawrence Graff (Otherwise known as MLG):<br>
    MLG is not a coincidence of a name. He’s the “radical bro” type and enjoys video games. He owns a sniper rifle and the only reason he’s allowed to bring it is because Ms. Circle likes that he can kill people for her, even if it’s mostly unintentional. He does have a girlfriend but she’s not finalized yet. He’s part of the nice kids group and tries to use his sniper rifle for protection. Half the time he just ends up nailing Abbie in the head when trying to do a 360 no-scope. Character by JS (the other guy)</p>

        <h2>The Routes</h2>

        <p>No, there is no neutral route. BUT in return, I made variations of the Pacafist and Genocide routes, along with a secret route that only the most sweaty of gamers will get. And yes, the game is planned to be about completionism, and the bonus route is most likely gonna be one of the most thought provoking, yet also content-filled route. Anyways, each route has 3 "tiers" which get more specific as they go on. Basically, the tier one of both routes is essentially a neutral route on steroids, with very specific decisions choosing whether you go down the geno or pacifist routes. If you do a whole lot more sparing than killing than in your average neutral route, you can get the tier two pacifist, and vise-versa. Total wipeout is tier three geno, and again vise-versa. </p>

        <p>Completing all 6 routes in the game will get you the bonus route, and you’ll see why I included it when it comes out.</p>
<br>
        <p>Okay time for the memes</p>

        <h2>The funny stuff</h2>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>There wasn’t much in this newsletter and don’t expect more in upcoming ones until game development really starts. </p>

        <p>Well, that’s all folks! See you all in winter!!</p>
